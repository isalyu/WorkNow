# WorkNow

## üî® What It Does

Do you get tired of filling out 50 different identical WorkDay applications for 50 different companies in your internship or job search? Do you wish 
you had one consolidated platform to be able to easily review all of your current, saved, and pending applications? WorkNow was created for just this 
purpose. WorkNow is a prototype of a website that demonstrates what an all-in-one, integrated, and intuitive to use version of WorkDay could look like. 

## üëÄ Features 

Upon logging in, the landing page shows the user how many status updates they have for all of their applications.

All applications are easily viewed in one cohesive page, separated with "In Progress," "Submitted," and "Saved" sections.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Do I Use It?

WorkNow demonstrates a UI of an idea our team was passionate about seeing realized, so for now you're still stuck using WorkDay. However, feel free to try 
it out to get a feel for the website, and [open an issue](https://github.com/isalyu/WorkNow/issues) if you see something that needs fixing or would like 
to see different functionality added!
